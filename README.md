### Company information

Gum, at its core, is a decentralized social media protocol on Solana. We unbundle traditional social media into Social Legos similar to how Defi unbundled traditional finance into Money Legos. Application developers can compose with Gum to build these features for any consumer apps like they are chewing gum.

Gum is bringing about a paradigm shift in how people build and use crypto apps.

Our protocol is open-sourced and we work closely with our community of developers who're building the next generation of consumer apps on crypto that will go mainstream as more people enter the space. In this role, you will have the opportunity to work closely with our team and build these apps yourself and show the world what's possible on Gum. You'll get to work closely with our team of developers as well as gain expertise on product, design, management and making open-sourced contributions. If the idea of fundamentally changing how people interact online forever excites you, Gum is the place you want to be working at.
